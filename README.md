# challenge
A repository for StreetShares challenges.

## Overview

Thanks for visiting the StreetShares challenge repo. This repo is for potential candidates that would like to join our Engineering team. If you are here, you are prolly doing pretty well already, and we have asked you for a Code Challenge.

All of the Code Challenges are meant to be fun, entertaining, and give you a chance to show off. All of our Coding Challenges will not be used in any way to advance the company, StreetShares, and hopefully, might give you a cool thing to show off in your own Github profile.

## Process

Open up a new Github repository in your Github profile with the given name. If you already have a repo with the same name, append the word `streetshares` or some other unique identifier in the repository name and let us know. Once you are ready to submit your challenge, notify us that you have completed the Challenge, provide us with a URL that points to the Github repository and make sure that the repository is public. We will review it and provide you with feedback.
