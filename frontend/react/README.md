## Project: What if Wikipedia was written in React components?

Take a simple website with not a lot of fancy HTML - think Craigslist 10 years ago, or Reddit 4 years ago. Pick your favorite so that it is fun. The Wikipedia page for [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number) is just a suggestion, but any other Wikipedia page would be fine. Wikipedia has a simple layout. Once you have selected a simple page, copy/paste the static HTML into a file inside your Git repository.

Your task is to take some static HTML, and chunk the HTML into a few React components. You do not have to complete the entire webpage - only a portion of it is fine.

## Requirements

1. Your project must include at least 5 React components
2. Your project must use jest to test the rendering of your React components.
3. Feel free to use the starter kit: `create-react-app` or any other starter kit if you prefer.
4. Provide a README at the top of the repo that includes:
  - how to install your app
  - how to test your app
  - how to start the webserver
